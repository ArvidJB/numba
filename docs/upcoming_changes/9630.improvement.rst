Allow caching of Numba functions within Zip files
-------------------------------------------------

This change enables numba functions imported from a file within a zip archive to
be cached, by recognizing a Zip file and using a user-wide cache directory
for the cache. Previously, Numba would fail.

For context, Zip archives are a supported-but-less-common way to distribute
python packages, and heavily used in PySpark.
